# ECE420_lab1_test_program
Little program for testing lab 1 of ECE420 at UofA, where we multiply square matrices with mutliple  threads to harness the benefits of parallelism

How to use this program:
1. Build the test executable using the makefile provided by calling make
2. Run the program in your terminal by calling:
   ./test arg1 arg2
    - arg1 is the path to directory with your main, matrixgen, and serialtester executables
       NOTE: These executables must already be built before the test program can work, and all must be in the same directory'
    - arg2 is the size of the largest matrix you would like to run a test on. The code has a hard cap at 256.
3. The terminal will print a success or fail message for each test
4. You can review the time taken for each test in the CSV file generated by the test program in the same directory as the 
   main executable
